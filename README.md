# Review by: Aaron Robinson
### Overall Feedback: The page works as intended and meets the requirements of the assignment. Although, I would try and add data valdiation for the time on the asking questions page. Maybe number vaidation and checking is the number is a valid hour time(1-12). Same for ReverseIt(alhpabetic). I like that your .js files are concise and neat. Other than those nitpicks, good job
